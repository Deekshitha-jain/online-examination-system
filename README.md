Technology Stack

Frontend:
HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling and layout.

Backend:
PHP: For server-side logic and handling database operations.
MySQL: For storing user data, test questions, and results.
XAMPP: For local development, running Apache server and MySQL.

Database Structure:
The database includes all the necessary tables which is required for fetching of the corresponding data's such as particular student, subject etc. 


Project Setup
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites:
Install XAMPP or any server running PHP and MySQL.
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. Setting Up the Database:
Open phpMyAdmin on your browser.
Create a new database (e.g., online_exam_system).
Import the provided database.sql file located in the sql/ folder into your newly created database.
3. Configuration:
Open the config.php file located in the root directory and update the port number if necessary.
Eg : if your MySQL is running on the port number 3306 then open the config.php file and update it as
$port = 3306; // Replace with your MySQL port number if different
NOTE: there is another config.php file in the fpdf folder so do update it here and also in the courses.php file as well.
5.FPDF Integration
The project uses FPDF, a popular PHP class for generating PDF files, to create certificates
Installing or Updating FPDF:
FPDF is already included in the project. However, if needed, you can download or update FPDF by following these steps:
Visit the official site: FPDF.org.
Download the latest version and replace the fpdf/ folder in your project directory with the updated one.
6. Running the Project:
Place the project or unzip the folder in the htdocs directory of XAMPP..
Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
Access the project by visiting http://localhost/online_exam_system/main.php in your web browser.
